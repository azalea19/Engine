S1, 2017 The basic Open\+GL Engine comes with an S\+DL owned window for rendering to Comes with the standard libraries \& managers ready to be used with the Open\+GL \& S\+DL A\+PI \hyperlink{class_shader}{Shader} Library Texture Library \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} Library Sound Manager Input Manager

The Render and Update are broken in to two functions Begin\+Render() is called before executing lua script render stuff and then End\+Render() is called afterwards \hyperlink{_engine_a_p_i_8cpp_adb032bce7d8debc11b6b5074c5b3b8ab}{Begin\+Update()} is called before executing lua script update stuff and then \hyperlink{_engine_a_p_i_8cpp_a14a73fee6a5920b912fb85bea1d5e0d7}{End\+Update()} is called afterwards
